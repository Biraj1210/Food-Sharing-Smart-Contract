# Food-sharing Platform with Tokens

## Project Title
Food-sharing Platform with Tokens

## Project Description
This project is a blockchain-based food-sharing platform where individuals can donate surplus food, and users can claim food items. Donors receive token rewards for their contributions, fostering a community-driven approach to reducing food waste.

## Project Vision
The vision of this project is to leverage blockchain technology to create a decentralized, transparent, and trust-based food-sharing ecosystem. By incentivizing donations with tokens, the platform encourages more people to participate in food donation initiatives, ultimately reducing food wastage and helping those in need.

## Future Scope
- Implementing a marketplace where users can trade tokens for food items.
- Integrating a reputation system to track donor reliability.
- Developing a mobile-friendly decentralized application (dApp) for better accessibility.
- Adding NFT-based proof-of-donation for accountability and recognition.
- Collaborating with restaurants and food businesses to expand the initiative.
